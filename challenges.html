        <h3>Challenges :</h3>
        <p>
          Cost: The production of green hydrogen is currently more expensive
          than conventional methods due to the high cost of electrolysis
          technology and renewable energy infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infrastructure: Limited distribution and storage infrastructure can
          make widespread adoption challenging
        </p>
        <p>
          Efficiency: The overall energy conversion process (from electricity to
          hydrogen and back to electricity) has lower efficiency compared to
          direct use of electricity.
        </p>

          Renewable Energy Dependency: Green hydrogen requires large amounts of
          renewable energy, which may strain already limited renewable energy
          resources needed for direct electrification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water Consumption: Electrolysis requires significant quantities of
          purified water, which could be a concern in water-scarce regions
