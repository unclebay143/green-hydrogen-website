        Green hydrogen is a type of hydrogen fuel that is produced using
        renewable energy sources. Unlike conventional hydrogen production
        methods, which often rely on natural gas or other fossil fuels and
        result in significant carbon emissions, green hydrogen is produced
        through the process of electrolysis. This process splits water (H2O)
        into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) using electricity generated by
        renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydropower.

          Green hydrogen is a clean energy source that's produced by splitting
          water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. Green
          hydrogen is a promising route to a net zero future. However, it
          currently makes up a small percentage of the overall hydrogen because
          production is expensive.As it becomes more common, the price of green
          hydrogen is expected to come down.
